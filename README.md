# INTEREPRET THAT IDIOM!

This is a fun game I made to be played with friends. The rules are customizable and so is the Idiom list. Add any idioms you would like to add in <a href="./idioms.json">idioms.json</a> or change any settings you would like to change in <a href="./game_settings.json">game_settings.json</a>.

## How to Use

To create the pdfs, run 
```
python -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
You should now see your updated PDF files in the <a href="./pdf_files/">pdf_files</a> directory. PDF Files with default values are already included. Enjoy!
